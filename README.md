Abstract: Diabetes is sometimes called the silent killer as it takes long for the symptoms to appear. In this paper 
we applied technology to predict diabetes at an earlier stage based on various features. For this, we used and 
applied three machine learning algorithms on the dataset obtained from UCI repository having 17 attributes and 
520 records of different patients. Algorithms including Random forest, Adaboost and Logistic regression were 
applied using the train-test split method. The accuracies obtained were further compared and best results were 
found using Random forest giving training accuracy of 100% and testing accuracy of 99.39%.



## Dataset Used

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishandutta/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction-dataset



## Methodology

### Libraries used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### Data Preprocessing
There is a possibility of the dataset being inconsistent, containing null values, duplicate or missing values. So data Preprocessing is done.

### Applying Algorithms
Algorithms applied are:
- Randon forest
- Logistic Regression
- Adaboost

### Comparison
After comparing accuracies of the above three algorithms, we obtained highest accuracy by Random forest algorithm, which gave training accuracy of 100% followed by testing accuracy of 99.36%
